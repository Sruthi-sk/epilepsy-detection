Methods for prediction of epilepsy onset in EEG

Classification of EEG data (2s epochs): Control, Interictal, Peri-ictal
Note: Ictal not chosen - this algorithm is to be optimized for prediction of epilepsy onset

Methods
- 1D CNN (97% accuracy) - (Increase with more data, training epochs, filters)

Code for simulation of real-time classification present in epilepsy_classification_1DCNN.py
